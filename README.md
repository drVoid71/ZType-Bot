# ZType-Bot
A bot that can play ZType really fast and hardly even miss a keystroke.

This bot is perhaps the world's unofficial fastest bot that can reach **Waves 100+ without missing a keystroke** (i.e. 100% accuracy).

# How to start the bot

The process is quite simple, follow these steps:
1. For the savvy: 
	1. Open up the JavaScript (Web) Console.
2. For the non-savvy:
	1. There are shortcut keys to bring up the JavaScript Web Console; they just vary depending on the web browser you're using.
	2. **Press F12**
	3. Click the **Console Tab**. 
3. Copy & Paste the code into the console and hit enter.
4. Start a new game.
5. Enjoy!

The bot will automatically **STOP** as soon as it's game over.  If you __need__ to stop the bot before this happens:
1. You can just call the __stopMain()__ function; which is called when the game is in __game over state__.
2. You need only reload (refresh) the website, or just close the tab/browser.

# End Result: Wave 105 with Accuracy of 100%

Wave 105 is not necessarily the limit but with sufficient computational power it can get you to Waves 100+.  The highest Wave I've seen it play is Wave 108; by that point it's just impossible to see what's going on other than moving progressing through Waves and the __Game Over__ screen.

The specs of the computer in which the bot was able to reach the Wave in the screenshot are:
* Quad-core CPU (3.6GHz; non-ARM CPU)
* 16GB RAM
* More than 250GB of __solid-state__ storage
* Powerful discrete GPU

# End notes

Creating a bot that can play ZType fast enough to beat other bots at reaching higher Waves proved to be quite a challenge, more than what I expected.  If this wasn't enough of a challenge, settling with a bot that can reach a high wave count with an accuracy less than 100% was even more challenging and required me to re-think many times how to solve both things at the same time.

This small project turned out to be pretty fun actually, as the bot "evolved" (in the sense of me re-thinking and improving it) it felt quite awesome seeing how the bot was able to surpass my personal score (between Wave 15 and Wave 20) and keep pushing through the waves using different approaches.

Feel free to reach out to me to let me know what you think!

Do you think you can improve my Bot? Please do and show me!

Do have a Bot that can beat this Bot? Show me!
